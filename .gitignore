# Build resources (if icon.ico is generated and not source controlled)
# If build/ contains only source icons (like icon.png) you want to keep,
# then you might only ignore specific generated files within build/
# For now, let's assume you want to ignore the whole build folder if it contains generated files
# or if you only keep source icons like icon.png in it.
# If your build/ folder only contains source icons (e.g., icon.png) that you DO want to commit,
# then you would remove /build/ from here.
# Based on your screenshot, icon.ico is being generated *inside* build/, so ignoring it is good.
